Some other animal families, such as the Dudgeoneidae, Metarbelidae, and Ratardidae, have been included within this family time and again. The first is considered a distinct family of the Cossoidea today recognizable by their abdominal tympanal organs which the Cossidae lack, whereas the other two are usually kept in the Cossidae as subfamilies. Some unrelated millers were included in the Cossidae in error, too, such as the genus Holcoceroides which is more primitive Ditrysia, or the Andesianidae which are even more ancient Heteroneura.

The Cossidae were usually divided into six subfamilies. However, numerous new subfamilies have been described recently, the current taxonomy is:

- Subfamily Catoptinae
- Subfamily Chilecomadiinae
- Subfamily Cossinae
- Subfamily Cossulinae
- Subfamily Hypoptinae
- Subfamily Mehariinae
- Subfamily Metarbelinae (disputed)
- Subfamily Politzariellinae
- Subfamily Pseudocossinae
- Subfamily Ratardinae (disputed)
- Subfamily Stygiinae
- Subfamily Zeuzerinae
- Genera Incertae sedis:
  - Acritocera
  - Anastomophleps
  - Archaeoses
  - Charmoses
  - Dolecta
  - Eusthenica (or in Glyphipterigidae)
  - â€ Gurnetia
  - Huayna
  - Psychidarbela
  - Ptilomacra
  - Schausiania
